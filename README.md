<strong>STACKOVERFLOW-LITE</strong>

StackOverflow-lite is a platform where people can ask questions and provide answers. It is built using node.js (written in ES6 and transpiled to ES5) which is a platform which allows us to run javascript on a computer/server, read, delete and update files, and easily communicate with a database which makes it a suitable choice for the stack-overflow-lite app.

<strong>CONTENTS</strong>

The contents of this app include:
 - The user interface which enables interaction between the front-end and back-end, designed using HTML, CSS and javascript without any frameworks.
 - The server side which is the backbone of the application. It is where the code is written and then used to control the front-end.
 - The database: The database used here is the postgresQL database which is simple to use and reliable as well.

<strong>PREREQUISITES</strong>

There are a few dependencies required to run this app - The express.js, a node.js web application server side javascript framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications, the body-parser, a middleware that extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body. This body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.

<strong>INSTALLATION</strong>

To install the dependencies, type in the script "npm install" without the quotes.
